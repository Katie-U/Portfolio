            Computer science is becoming a more and more important subject for children to learn.
            With computer science education, students are able to build computational thinking skills,
            a problem solving approach that involves breaking down a problem, identifying problems, 
            creating step by step solutions, and abstracting information. However, it can be difficult 
            for classrooms to include computer science topics, especially in younger grades when teachers
            may not know or understand the topics. The purpose of Modeler is to fill that gap, to support 
            the building of computational thinking skills in classrooms that arenâ€™t computer science based. 
            Modeler serves to structure the experience of modeling a topic, one that might not normally be 
            modeled such as the relationships in a novel. This is accomplished in three steps: diagramming 
            the relationships through the use of different shapes, arrows, and labels; providing measurements
            or changes in the relationships; and a moving or changing simulation that is created by the system 
            to display the relationships as defined.

            For this project, I worked to define the user work flow and the user interface. This was accomplished
            by talking with computer science professors at Michigan Tech to understand what steps of learning
            computer science and what could be applied to other topics. The design was also based on the ideas
            and feedback of the primary investigator. The design is meant to invoke the feeling of more traditional
            educational software, but not feel outdated. The primary investigator was interested in a retro feel 
            for the design, especially during the initial stages of the design process. An important aspect of the
            design was to have a place for students to reflect on their process and take notes about what they were
            doing. It was not enough for them to just mindlessly experience the simulation, but to reflect on the
            process.

            I created an animation based on the early interface prototype to help understand the process and what
            using the system could actually look like. It describes a basic photosynthesis process. This animation
            was meant to help the developers better understand the relationship between pages and what different
            components do. This method was chosen over a static document as the primary investigator wanted a 
            medium that could be shown to other people who had no understanding of the design or development 
            process, such as professors from other departments or high school teachers.
