                    At Michigan Tech, I recieved my Bachelors in psychology and Human Factors and completed a minor in computer science, but I
                    also did a lot outside of academics. I worked in two research labs focusing on computer science education; I helped teach 
                    introduction computer science courses; I was president of the Association of Psychology Students and The Quiz Bowl Club; 
                    and I was the Varsity Esports Team Statistician.
