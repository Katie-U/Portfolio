        <p class = "introduction"> 
            During my time at Michigan Tech, I participated in the enterprise program. The enterprise program
            is designed to provide practical experience for students, through working with real world problems 
            and clients as well as working together to solve a problem. I was a part of the humane interface design
             enterprise (HIDE). This enterprise focuses on software development and usability research. During 
            that time, I worked on a number of projects with my team, laid out here.
