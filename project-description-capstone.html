        <h1>Capstone Project with South Fayette: Stack Builder</h1>

            As part of my Masters program, we must complete a capstone project.
            This allows us to have practical experiences working with clients
            and stakeholders to create real solutions. My team is working with 
            South Fayette high school in Mcdonald, PA. The goal of this project 
            is to move away from the method of education where students get 
            trapped in one topic or subject area even before reaching college. 
            Our goal is to increase student autonomy and internal motivation to 
            help them find the best path forward for their future, whether that 
            be college or straight into the job force.

            In order to achieve this, our group started by researching the problem space.
            This included background research such as competitive analysis of other 
            school districts and doing research into the history of education in general.
            We interviewed stakeholders to understand what was important to them and what
            motivates them. Our stakeholders include students, parents, teachers, and 
            administrative staff. We also used participatory design methods to gain 
            insights about our clientâ€™s vision for the project. We shared our research
            with our clients and are using their feedback to direct the next stage of development
            for this project.

         As a team, we created prototypes to test assumptions of what could work. This included
          a variety of methods such as interviews, Wizard of Oz studies with AI recommendations,
           and cardboard prototypes. During this stage, our prototypes were meant to be tested
            quickly and to gain insights for specific questions and problems. We were able to use 
            the information that we learned from the prototyping phase to create our final solution.

            Our solution is a software that we called Stacks. This software is designed to help
             students track what they have done and use that information to help them discover 
             new patterns or options. Students can view their experiences in different ways, 
             such as a time line or clustering similar things together. Stacks tracks not only
              classwork, but extracurriculars and opportunities outside of school. This allows 
              for the student to get a more complete view of what they are interested in. For 
              this project, I created a database to hold student, class, extracurricular, and 
              general event information. I also helped create an AI recommendation system that 
              provides students with recommendations based on their interests and previous experiences.
