            As part of my Masters program, we must complete a capstone project.
            This allows us to have practical experiences working with clients
            and stakeholders to create real solutions. My team is working with 
            South Fayette high school in Mcdonald, PA. The goal of this project 
            is to move away from the method of education where students get 
            trapped in one topic or subject area even before reaching college. 
            Our goal is to increase student autonomy and internal motivation to 
            help them find the best path forward for their future, whether that 
            be college or straight into the job force.

            In order to achieve this, our group started by researching the problem space.
            This included background research such as competitive analysis of other 
            school districts and doing research into the history of education in general.
            We interviewed stakeholders to understand what was important to them and what
            motivates them. Our stakeholders include students, parents, teachers, and 
            administrative staff. We also used participatory design methods to gain 
            insights about our clientâ€™s vision for the project. We shared our research
            with our clients and are using their feedback to direct the next stage of development
            for this project.

            Currently, we are working on creating prototypes to test assumptions of what
            could work. This includes a variety of methods such as interviews, Wizard of
            Oz studies with AI recommendations, and cardboard prototypes. At this stage,
            our prototypes are meant to be tested quickly and to gain insights for 
            specific questions and problems. The two prototypes shown here are a poster 
            meant to start conversations and cards meant to help students reframe their
            failures or mistakes into learning opportunities. This project is currently
            ongoing and we are looking forward to finishing this project.
