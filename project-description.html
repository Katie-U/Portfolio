    <h1>Enterprise: HIDE</h1>
    <div class = "projects" id = "intro">
        <p class = "projects"> 
            During my time at Michigan Tech, I participated in the enterprise program. The enterprise program
            is designed to provide practical experience for students, through working with real world problems 
            and clients as well as working together to solve a problem. I was a part of the humane interface design
            enterprise (HIDE). This enterprise focuses on software development and usability research. I
            participated on the Human Factors team, which was dedicated to helping the other teams create their
            interfaces and user experience flows. During that time, I worked on a number of projects with my
            team, laid out here.

    <h2>CS Scheduler</h2>
    <div class = "projects">
    
    <p class = "projects" id = "scheduler">
        The computer science department at Michigan Tech wanted a new way of scheduling classes and understanding
        visualising the data as they worked. Our team was asked to create a prototype for what the interface might
        look like. To accomplish this, we interviewed the development team and department staff who are responsible
        for the scheduling of classes. Based on these interviews, our team developed this prototype and presented it
        to the development team. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It is meant to mimic the layout and organization of Google Calendar because the department staff is already
        familiar with that product. They had previously been using spreadsheets, so presenting the information this
        way helps to show the conflicts that can occur between professors or specific classes. The screen is showing
        what it would look like to look at the schedule of a specific professor, while the calendar demonstrates what
        it would look like to see multiple professors at the same time. This prototype is an early design for the
        project. It is not the final design and I was moved to a different team before it was finished.

    <h2>Legal Paper Serving Platform</h2>
    <div class = "projects">
        <p class = "projects">
        This app is meant to assist people who serve legal papers for their job. I completed the most basic wireframe
        prototype for the development team. This was meant to serve as a proof of concept for the client as well as 
        guide the direction of the development team. The design is based on interviews with the client, who both served
        papers and oversaw others on his team. This app would be usable as both a website and as a mobile app, with the
        mobile app assisting in showing proof of papers served. I was moved to a different project before the designs
        were finalized.
