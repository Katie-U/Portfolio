            This website was created for a class assignment. The purpose of the 
            assignment was to gain more skill with the website design and 
            creation process. We also needed to use libraries within our project
            to demonstrate how programming is a collaborative problem and that
            we can implement otherâ€™s ideas into our own. The purpose of this website
            is to create cross stitch patterns, although it would also allow for
            someone to create any pattern that is block based. The functionality
            allows the user to upload a photo to the background to follow with
            and has the offical DMC colors to chose from when designing. 
            In order to create the website, I created 3 different versions
            in Figma. This allowed me to explore different screen layouts 
            and color choices quickly. This is the final design prototype
            that I based the final implementation on. To check out the website,
