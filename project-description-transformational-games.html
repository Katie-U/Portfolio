 <h1>Designing Transformational Games</h1>

            Transformational games was a class that centered around teaching the 
            design of games meant to elicit some kind of change from the player. 
            We designed physical games, games that used mechanics like dice rolling
            or basic card mechanics. Throughout the course, we focused on rapid 
            iteration, with the design life cycle for a game only lasting about 2 
            weeks. This helped to teach me the best ways to design and test rapidly 
            and what should be focused on when you only have a short amount of time 
            to design. In addition, we also had a group game assignment. This helped 
            me understand the benefits of designing in a team and how to manage design
            work in a group. The entire process was collaborative, from the brainstorming
            to the final product. It was a learning opportunity that allowed me to 
            understand the way that designs and ideas change when working as a team. 
            Our team designed a game that is meant to encourage players to think about 
            climate issues and challenges from perspectives that may be different from 
            their own. This is meant to help teach players how to have difficult 
            conversations about the climate with people who may not agree with them 
            or may not understand their perspective. Each player is given a role 
            with secret goals they must accomplish throughout the game while trying 
            to come up with the best solutions to different problems.
