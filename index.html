                    At Michigan Tech, I recieved my Bachelors in Psychology and Human Factors and completed a minor in computer science, but I
                    also did a lot outside of academics. I worked in two research labs focusing on computer science education; I helped teach 
                    introduction computer science courses; I was president of the Association of Psychology Students and The Quiz Bowl Club; 
                    and I was the Varsity Esports Team Statistician. See some of the projects I worked on below:

                At Carnegie Mellon, we have this as the moto and I feel that it 
                describes the way that I want to approach my work, skills, and hobbies.
                I am a huge nerd who also loves crafting and design and sometimes that 
                shines through to my work.
