                    At Michigan Tech, I recieved my Bachelors in Psychology and Human Factors and completed a minor in computer science, but I
                    also did a lot outside of academics. I worked in two research labs focusing on computer science education; I helped teach 
                    introduction computer science courses; I was president of the Association of Psychology Students and The Quiz Bowl Club; 
                    and I was the Varsity Esports Team Statistician. See some of the projects I worked on below:

                    At Carnegie Mellon, I am working towards my Masters in Human Computer Interaction. I've worked on a wide range of projects 
                    and had many new experiences that have helped me to grow my skills. A major part of program is the capstone project. See some
